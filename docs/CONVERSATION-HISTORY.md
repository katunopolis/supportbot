## 2025-03-20: Message Visibility Bug Fix

### Issue
We identified an issue where admin and user could only see their own messages in the chat interface, despite messages being correctly stored in the database. This created a poor user experience where neither party could see responses from the other.

### Investigation
Upon investigation, we found that the bug was in the `addMessage` function in the `chat.html` file. The function was correctly receiving messages from both parties, but incorrectly styling them in a way that made messages from the other party either invisible or improperly displayed.

The root issues were:
1. The styling logic used CSS classes that aligned messages without proper differentiation
2. Type mismatches in user ID comparison (string vs number)
3. Lack of clear sender identification in the UI

### Solution
We implemented a comprehensive fix:
1. Updated the message rendering logic to properly show all messages
2. Added proper type conversion for user ID comparison
3. Added sender labels to clearly show who sent each message
4. Improved message styling with better differentiation
5. Added message deduplication to prevent duplicate messages on reconnection
6. Added extensive debug logging

### Impact
This fix significantly improves the user experience by:
1. Ensuring both admin and user can see each other's messages
2. Making it clear who sent each message
3. Providing a more reliable chat experience
4. Preventing potential duplicate messages

## 2025-03-20: ISO 8601 Timestamp Handling and Chat Fixes

### Issue 
The chat functionality between users and admins was not working correctly due to:
- Inconsistent timestamp handling across the application
- API routing issues in the proxy middleware
- Multiple polling instances causing duplicate messages
- Missing 'Z' suffix in UTC timestamps

### Solution
1. **API Routing Fix**:
   - Updated the proxy middleware in `main.py` to properly route chat list and message polling requests to the actual API handlers
   - Replaced the empty array response with actual calls to the appropriate API handlers

2. **ISO 8601 Timestamp Implementation**:
   - Standardized all timestamps to ISO 8601 format with UTC timezone
   - Added 'Z' suffix to indicate UTC for all timestamps
   - Implemented consistent `datetime.now(timezone.utc)` usage in the backend
   - Added timestamp validation and normalization on the frontend

3. **Improved Chat Polling**:
   - Enhanced polling logic to prevent multiple instances
   - Added cleanup of polling resources when page visibility changes
   - Implemented exponential backoff for error handling
   - Added proper timestamp comparison to prevent duplicate messages

4. **Testing and Documentation**:
   - Created comprehensive test script `test_timestamp_handling.py`
   - Added detailed documentation in `TIMESTAMP-HANDLING.md`
   - Updated troubleshooting guide with sections on chat polling and timestamp issues
   - Created changelog to track the changes

## March 31, 2025 - Ngrok Link Update Troubleshooting

### Issue
When trying to update the ngrok URL for the Telegram bot webhook, several issues were encountered:
1. The `ngrok_link_update.py` script was failing validation due to checking the root URL for a 200 status code
2. Environment variables in the Docker container weren't being updated properly
3. Container restarts weren't propagating the new environment variables

### Solution
The following steps were taken to resolve the issues:

1. **Script Validation Fix**:
   - Modified `validate_ngrok_url` function to check the `/webhook` endpoint instead of the root URL
   - Updated validation to accept 404/405 responses as valid (indicating endpoint exists)

2. **Docker Compose Configuration**:
   - Updated `docker-compose.yml` to use `env_file` instead of explicit environment variables
   - Removed redundant environment variable declarations
   - Ensured proper mounting of the `.env` file

3. **Update Process**:
   - Used the `webhook-update` command instead of `ngrok-update`:
     ```bash
     python run_test.py webhook-update --url https://your-ngrok-url.ngrok-free.app
     ```
   - This command handles:
     - Updating the `.env` file
     - Restarting all containers
     - Setting the webhook
     - Verifying the configuration
     - Sending a test message

4. **Verification Steps**:
   - Checked environment variables in the container:
     ```bash
     docker compose exec supportbot env | findstr RAILWAY
     ```
   - Verified webhook configuration through Telegram API
   - Confirmed test message delivery

### Documentation Updates
The following documentation was updated to reflect these changes:
1. `LOCAL-TESTING.md`: Added detailed section about ngrok URL updates and troubleshooting
2. Added validation error handling information
3. Updated container restart procedures
4. Added environment variable verification steps

### Lessons Learned
1. Always verify environment variables in the container after updates
2. Use the `webhook-update` command for more reliable updates
3. Ensure proper Docker Compose configuration for environment variables
4. Consider endpoint-specific validation instead of root URL checks
