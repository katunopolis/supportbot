## 2025-03-20: ISO 8601 Timestamp Handling and Chat Fixes

### Issue 
The chat functionality between users and admins was not working correctly due to:
- Inconsistent timestamp handling across the application
- API routing issues in the proxy middleware
- Multiple polling instances causing duplicate messages
- Missing 'Z' suffix in UTC timestamps

### Solution
1. **API Routing Fix**:
   - Updated the proxy middleware in `main.py` to properly route chat list and message polling requests to the actual API handlers
   - Replaced the empty array response with actual calls to the appropriate API handlers

2. **ISO 8601 Timestamp Implementation**:
   - Standardized all timestamps to ISO 8601 format with UTC timezone
   - Added 'Z' suffix to indicate UTC for all timestamps
   - Implemented consistent `datetime.now(timezone.utc)` usage in the backend
   - Added timestamp validation and normalization on the frontend

3. **Improved Chat Polling**:
   - Enhanced polling logic to prevent multiple instances
   - Added cleanup of polling resources when page visibility changes
   - Implemented exponential backoff for error handling
   - Added proper timestamp comparison to prevent duplicate messages

4. **Testing and Documentation**:
   - Created comprehensive test script `test_timestamp_handling.py`
   - Added detailed documentation in `TIMESTAMP-HANDLING.md`
   - Updated troubleshooting guide with sections on chat polling and timestamp issues
   - Created changelog to track the changes

The implementation ensures consistent timestamp handling across the entire application, enhancing reliability and preventing timezone-related issues.

## 2025-03-15: WebApp Integration

### Issue

### Solution
1. **Telegram WebApp Integration**:
   - Implemented WebApp support for Telegram
   - Created user-friendly form for support request submission
   - Designed a real-time chat interface for both users and admins

2. **Admin Panel Development**:
   - Created a comprehensive admin panel for managing support requests
   - Implemented admin chat interface with support for assigning and resolving requests
   - Added real-time notifications for new support requests

   - Set up the basic bot structure using python-telegram-bot
   - Implemented command handlers for /start, /help, and /request
   - Created backend API structure

2. **Database Design**:
   - Designed database models for requests and messages
   - Implemented SQLAlchemy ORM integration
   - Created session management

3. **Initial Deployment**:
   - Set up Docker containerization
   - Configured Railway deployment
   - Implemented webhook handling

The initial development established the core functionality of the Support Bot, providing a foundation for future enhancements.

## 2025-03-20: Message Visibility Bug Fix

### Issue
We identified an issue where admin and user could only see their own messages in the chat interface, despite messages being correctly stored in the database. This created a poor user experience where neither party could see responses from the other.

### Investigation
Upon investigation, we found that the bug was in the `addMessage` function in the `chat.html` file. The function was correctly receiving messages from both parties, but incorrectly styling them in a way that made messages from the other party either invisible or improperly displayed.

The root issues were:
1. The styling logic used CSS classes that aligned messages without proper differentiation
2. Type mismatches in user ID comparison (string vs number)
3. Lack of clear sender identification in the UI

### Solution
We implemented a comprehensive fix:
1. Updated the message rendering logic to properly show all messages
2. Added proper type conversion for user ID comparison
3. Added sender labels to clearly show who sent each message
4. Improved message styling with better differentiation
5. Added message deduplication to prevent duplicate messages on reconnection
6. Added extensive debug logging

### Impact
This fix significantly improves the user experience by:
1. Ensuring both admin and user can see each other's messages
2. Making it clear who sent each message
3. Providing a more reliable chat experience
4. Preventing potential duplicate messages

### Technical Details
The fix focused on the `addMessage` function in `chat.html`:
```javascript
function addMessage(message) {
    // Don't process duplicate messages (check by id if available)
    if (message.id) {
        const existingMsg = document.querySelector(`[data-message-id="${message.id}"]`);
        if (existingMsg) {
            console.log(`Message ID ${message.id} already exists, skipping`);
            return;
        }
    }
    
    const isAdmin = message.sender_type === 'admin';
    const isMine = message.sender_id.toString() === currentUserId.toString();
    
    // Create message div
    const messageDiv = document.createElement('div');
    
    // Apply appropriate classes for styling
    messageDiv.className = `message ${isAdmin ? 'admin-message' : 'user-message'} ${isMine ? 'my-message' : ''}`;
    
    // Add message ID as data attribute if available
    if (message.id) {
        messageDiv.setAttribute('data-message-id', message.id);
    }

    // Add sender identification
    const senderLabel = isAdmin ? 'Admin' : 'User';
    
    messageDiv.innerHTML = `
        <div class="message-sender">${isMine ? 'You' : senderLabel}</div>
        <div class="message-content">${escapeHtml(message.message)}</div>
        <div class="message-time">${time}</div>
        <div class="message-timestamp" style="display: none;">${timestamp}</div>
    `;
}
```

The CSS was also updated to provide better visual differentiation between message types.
