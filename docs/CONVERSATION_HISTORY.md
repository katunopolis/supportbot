### Issue Investigation and Resolution
- Identified critical bot initialization error with connection pool settings
- Discovered runtime error: "The parameter `pool_timeout` may only be set, if no bot instance was set"
- Found SQL syntax errors in database health checks
- Fixed application startup failures caused by incorrect initialization order

### Technical Analysis and Implementation

1. **Bot Initialization Sequence**
   ```python
   # Previous problematic implementation
   bot_app = Application.builder().bot(bot).concurrent_updates(True).pool_timeout(POOL_TIMEOUT).connection_pool_size(MAX_CONNECTIONS).build()

   # Fixed implementation with correct order
   bot_app = (
       Application.builder()
       .pool_timeout(POOL_TIMEOUT)
       .connection_pool_size(MAX_CONNECTIONS)
       .concurrent_updates(True)
       .bot(bot)
       .build()
   )
   ```

2. **Connection Pool Configuration**
   - Set optimal pool settings:
     ```python
     POOL_TIMEOUT = 30  # seconds
     MAX_CONNECTIONS = 100
     ```
   - Implemented proper health checks:
     ```python
     async def check_database():
         try:
             async with Session() as session:
                 await session.execute(text("SELECT 1"))
                 await session.commit()
                 return True
         except Exception as e:
             logging.error(f"Database connection test failed: {e}")
             return False
     ```
