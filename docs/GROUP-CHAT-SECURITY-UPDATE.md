# Group Chat Security Implementation

This document summarizes the changes made to implement secure access in group chat scenarios.

## Problem Statement

When a user sends the `/request` command in a public group, the support form button is generated for everyone to see. However, only the user who sent the command should be able to access the form and subsequent chat. We need to prevent other users from accessing the support system through someone else's request button.

## Implementation Summary

We've implemented a comprehensive security system with multiple layers of verification:

### 1. Bot Handler Changes

**File: `app/bot/handlers/start.py`**
- Modified `request_support_group` function to include the user's ID in the WebApp URL
- Changed button type from WebApp to URL due to Telegram API limitations in group chats
- Updated `request_support_private` for consistency, also including user ID parameter
- Enhanced `request_support` function to better log and handle different chat scenarios
- Added error handling with fallback mechanisms for button creation

#### Telegram API Limitation

We discovered that Telegram does not allow WebApp buttons in group chats, as per their API documentation:

> Description of the WebApp that will be launched when the user presses the button... **Available only in private chats between a user and the bot.**

To work around this limitation, we:
1. Use a standard URL button in group chats that links to the support form webpage
2. The URL contains the user's ID as a parameter for verification
3. When opened, the webpage performs the same security checks as would happen with a WebApp button
4. Ensure all security layers remain intact despite the different button type

This approach maintains security while ensuring functionality across both private and group chats.

### 2. Frontend Verification

**File: `webapp-support-bot/support-form.html`**
- Added user verification function that compares the URL parameter with the actual user's Telegram ID
- Implemented verification on page load and before form submission
- Added error messages and disabled form elements for unauthorized users

**File: `webapp-support-bot/chat.html`**
- Added `verifyUserAccess` function to check user authorization
- Restructured code to verify access before initializing the chat
- Created `initializeChat` function that only runs after successful verification
- Modified API calls to include the user_id parameter

### 3. Backend API Security

**File: `support-bot/app/api/routes/support.py`**
- Updated the following endpoints with user verification:
  - `GET /chat/{request_id}` - For accessing chat data
  - `POST /chat/{request_id}/message` - For sending messages
  - `POST /request` - For creating support requests
- Added comprehensive logging for verification events
- Implemented graceful error handling with appropriate HTTP status codes

### 4. Schema Organization

**File: `support-bot/app/schemas/request.py`**
- Created dedicated schema file for request-related models
- Enhanced schema organization for better maintainability
- Updated imports across the codebase to use the new schema location

### 5. Documentation

**File: `support-bot/docs/SECURITY.md`**
- Created comprehensive security documentation
- Detailed the implementation of the security system
- Provided code examples and explanations

**File: `support-bot/docs/CHANGELOG.md`**
- Updated the changelog to reflect security improvements
- Documented all changes made to implement the security system

## Security Flow

1. User sends `/request` command in a group chat
2. Bot creates a button with a WebApp URL containing the user's ID
3. When a user clicks the button:
   - Frontend verifies if the clicking user's ID matches the URL parameter
   - If verification fails, an error message is shown and the form is disabled
   - If verification passes, the form is enabled for submission
4. When submitting the form or using the chat:
   - The user_id parameter is included in all API calls
   - Backend verifies the user's permission to access the request
   - Unauthorized access attempts are rejected with 403 Forbidden

## Future Improvements

- Add cryptographic signing of user IDs for even stronger security
- Implement session-based verification for longer-term interactions
- Create an admin monitoring system for unauthorized access attempts

## Conclusion

The implemented security system provides a robust solution to the problem of unauthorized access in group chat scenarios. With multiple verification layers and comprehensive error handling, we've ensured that only the requesting user can access their support form and chat while maintaining a good user experience.
